               ArtistGender = as.factor(ArtistGender),

For this section, we are going to perform hypothesis tests to compare audio features based on different groups. We will do so one audio feature at a time based on attributes such as Artist Gen, Artist Gender, Artist Type.

First let's see the breakdown of number of observations in each gorup.
```{r}
#songs per kpop generation
round(table(data$ArtistGen)/nrow(data),3)
#songs per gender of artist
round(table(data$ArtistGender)/nrow(data),3)
#songs per Artist Type (group v solo)
round(table(data$ArtistType)/nrow(data), 3)
```

The groups are in very unequal balance making a very uneven comparison. Instead of comparing all generations, split into old and new. Instead of comparing gendered groups to one another or 
```{r}
#1 is old gen 0 is new generation
data$oldgen <- as.factor(ifelse(data$ArtistGen == 1 | data$ArtistGen == 2, 1, 0))
# 1 is boy groups and 2 is girl groups, 0 is all others.
data$bg <- as.factor(ifelse(data$ArtistType == "group" & data$ArtistGender == "male", 1, 
                            ifelse(data$ArtistType == "group" & data$ArtistGender == "female", 2, 0)))
```

```{r}
# songs per old vs new gen
round(table(data$oldgen)/nrow(data),3)
# songs per 
round(table(data$bg)/nrow(data),3)
```


# Hypothesis testing across kpop generations
```{r}
## all generations
gen1 <- filter(data, ArtistGen == 1)
gen2 <- filter(data, ArtistGen == 2)
gen3 <- filter(data, ArtistGen == 3)
gen4 <- filter(data, ArtistGen == 4)

## Reducing the groups
oldgen <- filter(data, oldgen == 1)
newgen <- filter(data, oldgen == 0)

# Hypothesis testing between Kpop Group types (Girl Group vs Boy Group)

This grouping is used since the balance between categories of groups and soloists are VERY uneven. In the kpop industry groups are dominant in the genre.

girl.group <- filter(data, ArtistType == "group" & ArtistGender == "female")
```
